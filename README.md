# My Panda Theme

I have created my own [Bear](https://bear.app/) theme, which is based on the *â€ŒD.Boring* theme and ~~a rip-off from~~ **heavily** inspired by [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer). It uses:

- iA Mono Writer Mono of the open source [iA-Fonts](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts)
- A combination of the iA Writer color scheme, the original color scheme and some custom colors
- A huge font size because i'm blind ðŸ¤“
